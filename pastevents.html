					<article><b>Took place on Saturday, July 9, 2016</b><br><br>

					This event has become another TRAA tradition. Members have been helping the Fanshawe Campers Association with the Family Fishing Day for many years now.<br><br>

					We help the kids rig up, sort out the odd tangle, help measure and release fish; we're just there to generally show them some fishing basics.<br><br>

					TRAA members that have come come out to this event in past years find it both fun and rewarding.<br><br>

					We'll be setting things up at the Fanshawe Conservation Area's boat ramp area starting at 7:30am so everything's ready when families start showing up at 9:00am. The event wraps up at 1:00pm.
					If you can only come out for a couple of hours that's OK. That way if we have members showing up mid to late morning, that'll allow us to help out in shifts.<br><br>

					If you have any questions please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>..</article>

					<article><b>Took place on Saturday, June 23, 2013</b><br><br>

					This year we were pleased to welcome visitors from Chipewas of the Thames First Nation, to tour the trout hatchery and assist us with the release of more than 40,000 rainbow trout.<br><br>

					Everyone was thrilled that the bald eagles with their young ones were keeping an eye on the proceedings at the release site.<br><br>

					This was another successful year and those volunteers on the trout hatchery rotation are to be commended.<br><br>

					The trout hatchery will undergo roof repairs as a result of a damaging blow from a fallen tree.<br><br>

					Otherwise, the hatchery will be idle for the summer except for routine maintenance.<br><br>

					If you'd like to be part of the hatchery rotation and other TRAA activities just <a href="contact.html">contact us.</a></article>
