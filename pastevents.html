					Dan Shinkelshoek made a video of the proceedings and it's worth a look so click on the picture to view.<br><br>

					This year we be mixed it up a bit by having the Annual TRAA Paddle & Fish on Sharon Creek Reservoir.<br><br>

					A thunderstorm threatened but only gave us a few minutes of rain to cool us off.<br><br>

					Fish targeted were largemouth bass, crappie and other panfish as well as some bruiser carp.<br><br>

					Many bass were caught with some crappies mixed in to make it interesting. Paul Holmes ended up with the largest fish, a nice smallmouth bass.<br><br>

					An informal BBQ lunch followed with Rick Ornato supplying the grill and the cooking expertise - Thanks Rick!</article></div>

					We were very excited to have a group from the MNRF's Stewardship Youth Rangers Program to do some work on Komoka Creek. This program gives groups of 16 or 17 year-olds an opportunity to spend 8 weeks working outdoors on natural resource management projects in their own community.<br><br>

					They worked on clearing a section of Komoka Creek upstream of the TRAA trout hatchery.  A major tree had fallen and a lot of the bank went with it. This created a blockage and was diverting the stream, increasing the likelihood of further bank side damage and erosion.
					We were also fairly certain that this was a barrier to migratory and resident fish passage. </article></div>

					As most members already know, a large tree was blown down during high winds on May 2nd.<br><br>

					Ironically, barely a week before this happened, we had already removed a couple of dead trees that had been identified as potential hazards to the hatchery.<br><br>

					At the time, we thought this tree wasn't a threat as it was well up the hill and well off to one side.<br><br>

					It unfortunately glanced off of a couple of other trees as it fell, steering it directly on to the hatchery roof!<br><br>

					The resulting damage, shown in this picture after the tree was removed, will required the replacement of these metal roof panels and the plywood sheathing underneath them. In addition, a couple of the roof trusses needed to be repaired.<br><br>

					It was an incredibly hot morning but the job was finished in record time. 
					There were materials left over for the tool shed roof as well but that will be another day!<br><br>

					If you have questions about this event or would like to get involved with other hatchery projects, please contact us.</article></div>

					A huge "Thank You" goes out to Pat, Dave and all the gang at Angling Sports for giving us space to set up our snazzy new banners
					Also many thanks to those TRAA members who took the tiime to hang out at the show, chatting to folks about what the TRAA does and generally about fishing in and around London.</article></div>

					The rainbow trout fingerlings that we raised from eggs over this past winter were released into Dingman Creek.<br><br>

					This year the TRAA welcomed the ECO Club from Louise Arbour French Immersion Public School, to come out and assist successfully releasing in excess of 40,000 rainbow trout.<br><br>

					Both the weather and the water conditions were nearly perfect, adding to a fun and rewarding learning experience for these enthusiastic students.<br><br>

					The trout hatchery is now idle and will undergo some upgrades over the summer in addition to the regular yearly maintenance. If you'd like to get in on this and other TRAA activities just contact us.</article></div>

					The brook trout fingerlings went on the annual road trip throughout rural areas northeast of London to be released into several different cold water tributaries. These were brook trout eggs that we harvested with folks from the Upper Thames Conservation Authority (UTRCA) to be raised in the TRAA trout hatchery.<br><br>

					Thanks to everyone that has put in their time and effort to collect the brook trout eggs, monitor them in the hatchery and participate in the release.<br><br>

					TRAA members Rob and Owen Huber, Stan Gibbs, and Bill Vandewetering did most of the transfer and transportation duties with the support of the Upper Thames Conservation Authority, Ministry of Natural Resources.<br><br>

					Special thanks to all of the landowners for being involved with the habitat improvements of these little coldwater streams into which these trout were released.</article></div>

					This event has become another TRAA tradition. Members have been helping the Fanshawe Campers Association with the Family Fishing Day for many years now.<br><br>

					We help the kids rig up, sort out the odd tangle, help measure and release fish; we're just there to generally show them some fishing basics.<br><br>

					TRAA members that have come come out to this event in past years find it both fun and rewarding.<br><br>

					We'll be setting things up at the Fanshawe Conservation Area's boat ramp area starting at 7:30am so everything's ready when families start showing up at 9:00am. The event wraps up at 1:00pm.
					If you can only come out for a couple of hours that's OK. That way if we have members showing up mid to late morning, that'll allow us to help out in shifts.<br><br>

					If you have any questions please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>..</article></div>

					<div class="articleImg Img9" id="Img9"><div class="articleTitle"><h2>Brown Trout Release</h2><span class="articleSubtitle">Took place on Monday, May 2, 2016</span></div><article class="articleContents"><br><br>

					The brown trout were successfully released with the help of 30 Grade 7/8 students from Oxbow Public School.<br><br>

					It was good timing as the rain stopped just as we showed up at the hatchery. Half of the students went for a stream tour lead by Bill Vandewetering and Richard Westelaken while the other half toured the hatchery operation.<br><br>

					During the stream tour the bald eagle showed up to its nest with a fish in its talons, much to the amazement of our guests.<br><br>
					 
					A "bucket brigade" was set up with the help of Pud Hunter, Ryan Simard, Ray Baxter, Fred Smithers and Stephen Jones to get the fish loaded into the transfer tank for the trip.<br><br>

					The release site on Oxbow Creek was absolutely stunning. The water was a bit murky but was shallow enough to be safe for the release. There was only a one degree difference between the stream temperature at the water in the hatchery so very little acclimating was required.<br><br>

					Special thanks go out to Dan Schinkelshoek and Adam Bengen for coordinating the trout release with the landowner as well as contacts from the Thames Valley District Scool Board and the Upper Thames Conservation Authority.<br><br>

					Also in attendance to help out were Julie Welker from the UTRCA and Erin Mutch from the TVDSB.<br><br>

					Judging by the smiles and wet feet of the students, a good time was had by all.

					TRAA members met with another group to do our yearly cleanup of the area around Komoka bridge (some may call it the Speedway bridge).<br><br>

					While a good amount of trash was removed from the area, participants commented that there seemed to be significantly less to pick up than in previous years. Let's hope that trend continues!<br><br>

					It's always a great way to get some fresh air, light exercise and top up your commitment to "give back".<br><br>

					Thanks go out to Jeremy Beaton for organizing the TRAA contingent.<br><br>

					There was hotdogs, burgers and lots of fun going on at this informal get-together.<br><br>

					Paul Noble put his barbequing skills to the test supplying a steady stream of hungry customers.<br><br>

					Ryan Simard spent most of his time trying to sell tickets for the "Count the Bobbers Contest". Ryan was also the main guy in organizing and pulling this whole event together - nice work Ryan!<br><br>

					Your ticket gave you a chance at a $100 gift certificate courtesy of Angling Sports! As an additional bonus, you also got the equivalent of the tax taken off any purchase in the Angling Sports store!<br><br>

					All the proceeds went to benefit the TRAA and our projects.<br><br>

					Once again, many thanks go out to Pat DeVincenzo and the folks at Angling Sports.

					This year we were pleased to welcome visitors from Chipewas of the Thames First Nation, to tour the trout hatchery and assist us with the release of more than 40,000 rainbow trout.<br><br>

					Everyone was thrilled that the bald eagles with their young ones were keeping an eye on the proceedings at the release site.<br><br>

					This was another successful year and those volunteers on the trout hatchery rotation are to be commended.<br><br>

					The trout hatchery will undergo roof repairs as a result of a damaging blow from a fallen tree.<br><br>

					Otherwise, the hatchery will be idle for the summer except for routine maintenance.<br><br>
